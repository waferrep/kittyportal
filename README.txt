This is a site dedicated to serving as my own personal "blog", with various updates about my life and progress in various fields.

Each blog page options in a modal window, so no need to open new tabs!

There's also randomization with various elements on the screen, and a live chat integrated with Chattable!

If I push out a change and you're not receiving it, please force refresh with CTRL+F5 / Shift+F5!
