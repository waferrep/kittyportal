                    im actually writing this right after writing the about me but.. no one has to know <img src="blog/moods/smash.gif" alt="smashing hammer gif"></p>
                <p>
                    i'm very fortunate(?) to have been laid off last week... i don't really like financial insecurity, but i've got so much more freetime now...</p>
                <p>
                    i've spent the last 4 days or so working 18 hour days to get this site finished (RIP sleep schedule) <img src="blog/moods/yawn.gif" alt="yawn gif">, so by the time ur seeing this, i hope i'm basically done with the engineering!</p>
                <p>
                    my album is also making rlly good headway! i'll probably have a cool post about that when it's out </p>
                <p> 
                    outside of This Whole Website and music goals,,, it's kinda just career stuff now! if you know me from osu,,, i'm sorry to say that i'm not very involved now.. i'd much rather just spend time pursuing hobbies and making time with friends ;3 </p>
                <p>
                    feel free to dm me if you wanna catch up or something though!! my discord and socials are linked on this site and  i'd love to talk to a lot of you all again <3</p>
                <p>
